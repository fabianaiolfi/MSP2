## Literature Review and Theory

### Party Agenda Setting

Agendas are considered to be a hierarchy of issues [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 260]. Relevant actors, e.g., political parties, can influence but must also pay attention to these issues. These actors place topics on their agenda that are salient amongst the public [@sidesOriginsCampaignAgendas2006 407]. They do this because setting an agenda, and thus determining what politics is about, is a form of wielding political power [@schattschneiderSemisovereignPeopleRealist1975 68; @edwardsWhoInfluencesWhom1999 327].

One way of placing topics on the agenda is by touching upon these topics in parliamentary bills. These bills are put forward by a variety of actors, one of them being political parties that aim at influencing the “party system agenda”. This is a model that describes how political parties set the agenda in the context of issue competition [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 257]. In this model, the “party system agenda” is influenced by permanent debate among political parties [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 260]. This debate takes on many forms, one of which is the proposal of new bills [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 266].

Parties react to each other’s agendas within the context of this “party system agenda” [@spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 374]. On the one hand, parties underline issues that provide an advantage to them. However, parties also have to react to all salient issues in the “party system agenda” at any time [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 261], even if they are potentially harmful.

Parties with similar ideology tend to react more responsively to each other than parties with less similar ideology. This phenomena, coined the “party bloc effect” [@green-pedersenAvoidanceEngagementIssue2015 760; @adamsPolicyAdjustmentParties2009 842], is attributable to the ideological vicinity between parties within the same bloc.

This vicinity allows for parties to win over voters from other, ideologically close parties. An example of this “poaching” is provided by @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 [375], who shows that if left-wing parties highlight issues typically dominated by green parties (in short, “green issues”), these left-wing parties can reap potential electoral benefits. In the specific context of Swiss politics, there are two further reasons why left-wing parties would want to highlight “green issues”.

First, “green issues” have become more salient in Switzerland in the past twenty years. @luthElectoralImportanceEvolution2022 [171] show that the electoral importance of energy and environmental issues has increased amongst Swiss voters between 2002 and 2022. This increase in salience is driven by voters [@luthElectoralImportanceEvolution2022 184], thus political parties must react to this development and place “green issues” on their agenda.

Second, I argue that the Swiss Social Democrats (German “Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz”, SP) consider the Swiss Green Party (German “Grüne Schweiz”, GPS) to be an electoral threat. Both parties are ideologically close, i.e., in the same “party bloc” as described above. The GPS has increased their vote share in the Swiss National Council from 7.43% in 2003 to 13.24% in 2019, while the SP has decreased their vote share in the same time span from 23.33% to 16.84%. According to @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 [366], a mainstream party such as the SP is more likely to engage with owned issues if niche parties, such as the GPS, is perceived to be an electoral threat. Thus we can expect the SP to counter this threat by addressing green issues with the aim of winning over GPS voters.

Following this argumentation, I posit that parties place topics in the “party system agenda” by putting forward parliamentary bills that, first, touch upon topics that are salient amongst the public and second, are advantageous for the parties themselves.

Following @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 [375], left-wing parties put forward bills that touch upon “green topics” in order to gain an electoral benefit. Therefore, in an effort to win over GPS voters, the SP highlights “green issues”. The SP does this by putting forward parliamentary bills that are similar in terms of content to bills put forward by the GPS. This leads to my hypothesis:

**H1**: An increase in the salience of environmental topics among the public leads to an increase in the semantic similarity between SP and Green bills on green topics.

### Calculating Document Similarity using Word Embeddings

In order to test the hypothesis, the semantic similarity between parliamentary bills needs to be measured. This means that the bills’ *content* must be taken into account when measuring similarity. This leads into the realm of natural language processing, short NLP, and approaches that use text as data [@rodriguezWordEmbeddingsWhat2022a]. In NLP terms, how can the semantic similarity between documents, more specifically parliamentary bills, be calculated [@aliSemanticSimilarityMeasures2018 907]?

@wangMeasurementTextSimilarity2020 [4] suggests the “Word Mover’s Distance” as a way to measure semantic distance between documents. This technique applies the concept of text representation in semantic space as a way to measure similarity. The idea behind this is to represent a text as a point in a multidimensional semantic space [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 109]. In this space, semantically similar texts are closer to each other than disimilar words. Thus the distance between two texts in this space allows to make a statement about their semantic similarity.

In order to place text in this semantic space, a text’s meaning needs to be converted to embeddings. These embeddings are learned representations of word meanings [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 105]. In short, these representations are calculated using the likelihood that a word appears near another word in the same text [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 122]. The representations take the form of vectors [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 109], which are simply a list of numbers [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 111] that provide the location of a text in the semantic space.

Embeddings are good at recognising synonyms, e.g., showing that the words “car” and “automobile” have high semantic similarity [@jurafskySpeechLanguageProcessing 121]. For this reason it makes sense to use embeddings to measure the semantic distance between documents, in this case parliamentary bills. Furthermore, in the realm of political science, embeddings have also been used to measure candidate positions [@caseMeasuringStrategicPositioning2023 11] and party ideology [@rheaultWordEmbeddingsAnalysis2020 29]. They are thus a tried and tested technique when analysing political texts. Finally, this described principle of embedding single words can be scaled onto entire documents, whereby a document forms a point in semantic space instead of a single word [@leDistributedRepresentationsSentences].

In sum, in order to measure the similarity between two parliamentary bills, I will place them in semantic space. The more similar the bills, the smaller the distance between them in the semantic space. The next section explains the technical details behind this approach.
