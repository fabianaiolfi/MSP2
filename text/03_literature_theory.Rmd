## Literature Review and Theory

- How do parties pick the topics to place on their agenda? And how do parties react to these topics?

- agendas are considered to be a hierarchy of issues (2010 green pedersen p. 260), that relevant actors have to pay attention to and can also influence
- 2006 sides p. 407: candidates place salient topics on their agenda (that are salient amgonst the public?) because setting a (policy) agenda and thus determining what politics is about is a form of wielding political power (1960 Schattschneider, p. 68; 1999 edwards, p. 327.)

- one way of placing topics on the agenda is to introduce them as parliamentary bills. (2010 green pedersen) describe how the “party system agenda emerges from the continuous political debate among political parties” (p. 260) which is “institutionalised in various […] ways” (p. 261), one of which is the proposal of new bills (p. 266).

- once the topics are on the agenda, parties (=candidates) react to each other’s agendas in the context of the “party system agenda” (2014 spoon p. 374). this is an “agenda-setting model of issue competition among political parties” (2010 green pedersen, p. 257).
- parties try to “emphasis advantageous issues in order to influence the party-system agenda” but “parties must also respond to whatever issues are salient at any given time” (2010 green pedersen p. 261).

- parties who are in the same bloc tend to react more responsively to each other than parties in different blocs. this is called the “party bloc effect” (2014 green p. 760; 2009 adams p. 842). this is due to ideological closeness between parties that are within the same bloc.

- this closeness allows for parties to win over voters from another ideologically close party.
- an example of this winning over is provided by (2014 spoon p. 375), who shows that if left-wing parties highlight green issues, they can reap potential electoral benefits.

- in the specific context of swiss politics, there are two further reasons why left-wing parties would want to highlight green issues

1. environmental issues have become more salient in ch in the past 20 years
- 2022 lüth, p. 171: between 2002 and 2022, the electoral importance of energy and environmental issues increases amongst voters in CH; p. 184: the salience of environmental topics is driven by voters.
- thus by highlighting salient issues, left-wing parties can set the agenda and determine what politics is about

2. sp can consider greens to be a threat
- (2014 spoon p. 366, via meguid) “mainstream parties are more likely to respond to issue when niche parties are perceived to be an electoral threat”. as the swiss greens are in the same party bloc as / ideologically close to the social demoracts and have increased their vote share in the swiss national parliament from x% to y% from 2004 to 2019, they can be perceived to be an electoral threat to the sp. thus we can expect the sp to counter this threat by attempting to win over Green voters by addressing green issus.

- following this framework, i argue that parties place topics in the “party system agenda” by putting forward parliamentary bills that touch upon topics that are salient amongst the public and advantageous for the parties themselves
- following 2014 spoon p. 375 described above, left-wing parties put forward bills that touch upon green topics for electoral benefit
- thus, i argue that in an attempt to win over green voters, the sp highlights green issues. the sp does this by putting forward bills that are substantively similar to bills put forward by the greens.

### Hypotheses
An increase in environmental topic salience amongst the public leads to an increase in similarity between SP and Green bills on green topics.
