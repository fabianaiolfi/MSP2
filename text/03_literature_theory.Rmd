## Literature Review and Theory

- How do parties pick the topics to place on their agenda? And how do parties react to these topics?

Agendas are considered as a hierarchy of issues (2010 green pedersen p. 260). Relevant actors, e.g., political parties, can influence but must also pay attention to these issues. These actors place topics on their agenda that are salient amongst the public (2006 sides p. 407). They do this because setting an agenda, and thus determining what politics is about, is a form of wielding political power (1960 Schattschneider, p. 68; 1999 edwards, p. 327).

One way of placing topics on the agenda is by touching upon these topics in parliamentary bills. These bills are put forward by a variety of actors, one of them being political parties that aim at influencing the “party system agenda”. This is a model that describes how political parties set the agenda in the context of issue competition (2010 green pedersen, p. 257). In this model, the “party system agenda” is influenced by permanent debate among political parties (2010 green pedersen, p. 260). This debate takes on many forms, one of which is the proposal of new bills (2010 green pedersen, p. 266).

Parties react to each other’s agendas within the context of this “party system agenda” (2014 spoon p. 374). On the one hand, parties underline issues that provide an advantage to them. However, parties also have to react to all salient issues in the “party system agenda” at any time (2010 green pedersen p. 261), even if they are potentially harmful.

Parties with similar ideology tend to react more responsively to each other than parties with less similar ideology. This phenomena, coined the “party bloc effect” (2014 green p. 760; 2009 adams p. 842), is attributable to the ideological vicinity between parties within the same bloc.

This vicinity allows for parties to win over voters from other, ideologically close parties. An example of this “poaching” is provided by Spoon (2014, p. 375), who shows that if left-wing parties highlight issues typically dominated by green parties (in short, “green issues”), these left-wing parties can reap potential electoral benefits. In the specific context of Swiss politics, there are two further reasons why left-wing parties would want to highlight “green issues”.

First, “green issues” have become more salient in Switzerland in the past twenty years. Lüth (2022, p. 171) show that the electoral importance of energy and environmental issues has increased amongst Swiss voters between 2002 and 2022. This increase in salience is driven by voters (Lüth 2022, p. 184), thus political parties must react to this development and place “green issues” on their agenda.

Second, I argue that the Swiss Social Democrats (German “Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz”, SP) consider the Swiss Green Party (German “Grüne Schweiz”, GPS) to be an electoral threat. Both parties are ideologically close, i.e., in the same “party bloc” as described above. The GPS has increased their vote share in the Swiss National Council from 7.43% in 2003 to 13.24% in 2019, while the SP has decreased their vote share in the same time span from 23.33% to 16.84%. According to Spoon (2014, p. 366), a mainstream party such as the SP is more likely to engage with owned issues if niche parties, such as the GPS, is perceived to be an electoral threat. Thus we can expect the SP to counter this threat by addressing green issues with the aim of winning over GPS voters.

Following this argumentation, I posit that parties place topics in the “party system agenda” by putting forward parliamentary bills that, first, touch upon topics that are salient amongst the public and second, are advantageous for the parties themselves.

Following Spoon (2014, p. 375), left-wing parties put forward bills that touch upon “green topics” in order to gain an electoral benefit. Therefore, in an effort to win over GPS voters, the SP highlights “green issues”. The SP does this by putting forward parliamentary bills that are substantively similar to bills put forward by the GPS. This leads to my hypothesis:

An increase in the salience of environmental topics among the public leads to an increase in the similarity between SP and Green bills on green topics.
