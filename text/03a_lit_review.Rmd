## Literature Review

Political agendas are a hierarchy of issues [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 260], whereby issues constitute problems that are important to voters (1996 Petrocik, p. 826). Relevant actors, such as political parties, influence this hierarchy of issues. Actors put issues on their agendas that are salient to the public [@sidesOriginsCampaignAgendas2006 407]. Defining and influencing agendas is important because it determines what politics is about and is therefore a way of exercising political power [@schattschneiderSemisovereignPeopleRealist1975 68; @edwardsWhoInfluencesWhom1999 327].

Parties respond to each other’s agendas as part of the “party system agenda” [@spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 374]. On the one hand, parties emphasise issues that are to their advantage. However, parties also have to respond to all salient issues in the “party system agenda” at all times [@green-pedersenWhoSetsAgenda2010 261], even if they are potentially damaging.

Parties with similar ideologies tend to be more responsive to each other than parties with less similar ideologies. This phenomenon, called the “party bloc effect” [@green-pedersenAvoidanceEngagementIssue2015 760; @adamsPolicyAdjustmentParties2009 842], is due to the ideological proximity between parties within the same bloc or party family.

What underpins this phenomenon? First, @green-pedersenAvoidanceEngagementIssue2015 [750] show that parties in the same bloc share issue preferences and thus have a common interest in focusing on the same issues. Second, the authors also explain that in a multiparty system, parties from the same party bloc are likely to be governmental coalition partners. In order to present themselves as a credible government alternative, parties from the same bloc need to show likeness by focusing on similar issues. Third, @adamsPolicyAdjustmentParties2009 [828] show how an ideological spatial argument supports the “party bloc effect”. The authors explain how parties that are close to each other in an ideological space, shift their policy positions when other parties in close proximity change their policy positions, as both parties, due to their ideological proximity, compete for a very similar set of voters. On the other hand, if a party that is ideologically further away shifts its policy position, the first party has no immediate reason to adjust its own position as a reaction.

	

- however, when looking at green parties and issues typically dominated by green parties (in short, “green issues”), literature shows diverging results when it comes to agenda response within the same party bloc
- on the one hand, 2014 abou-chadi shows that all left-wing mainstream parties de-emphasise green issues (p. 431), as green parties are considered successful green issue owners
- on the other hand, @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 [372, 373, 375] shows that when left-wing parties highlight “green issues”, these left-wing parties can reap potential electoral benefits [375]. this allows left-wing parties to “poach” green voters.
	- however, @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 describe the circumstances that have to exist for this to occur
	- first, public salience of the green issue has to be high which then makes vote gains due to green mobilisation more likely [372] and the electoral system has to be open to smaller parties [375]
	- second, the green party must be perceived as an electoral threat by left parties [366]

In the next section, I develop theoretical expectations about how the framework by @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 may apply in the Swiss case.
