## Theory and Hypothesis

```
ACM: remove explicit references to Switzerland here (you can just talk of Social Democrats and Green parties in general). 
```


Theoretical Framework

- How do political parties respond to the increased salience of environmental issues? Research shows that when these issues become more important to voters, political parties adjust their agendas to address these issues.
- More specifically, left-wing parties will adopt green issues.
- Specifically, we expect that a mainstream left-wing party, when perceiving a green party as a direct electoral threat, place issues on the "party system agenda" by proposing parliamentary bills that, first, touch on issues that are salient to the public and, second, are advantageous to the parties themselves
- these bills will be more similar in content to those proposed by the green party. This strategy is aimed at attracting voters who might otherwise support the green party.
- This adoption is thought to be a strategic move to attract voters from green parties.
- left-wing parties thus do this to gain electoral benefits.
- left-wing parties introduce bills that touch upon “green topics” in order to gain an electoral advantage.

**H1**: An increase in the public salience of environmental issues leads to an increase in the content similarity between parliamentary bills of mainstream left-wing parties and those of green parties on "green issues."


to test this hypothesis, i turn to the swiss case. the swiss case fits well into this framework because

- swiss public salience on green issues has increased in the past two decades
	- First, “green issues” have become more salient in Switzerland over the past twenty years. @luthElectoralImportanceEvolution2022 [171] show that the electoral importance of energy and environmental issues among Swiss voters has increased between 2002 and 2022. This increase in salience is driven by voters [@luthElectoralImportanceEvolution2022 184], thus political parties need to respond to this development and put “green issues” on their agenda.

- switzerland has a multi-party system with an electoral system that is open to smaller parties, as highlighted by @linderSchweizerischeDemokratieInstitutionen2017a [102]. the greens count as one of these smaller parties.

- greens are an electoral threat to the sp
	- Second, I argue that the Swiss Social Democrats (German “Sozialdemokratische Partei der Schweiz”, SP) perceive the Swiss Green Party (German “Grüne Schweiz”, GPS) as an electoral threat.

ACM: why an electoral threat?

Both parties are ideologically close, i.e., in the same “party bloc” as described above. The GPS has increased its share of votes in the Swiss National Council from 7.43% in 2003 to 13.24% in 2019, while the SP has decreased its share from 23.33% to 16.84% over the same period. According to @spoonGoingGreenExplaining2014 [366], a mainstream party like the SP is more likely to engage with issues owned by niche parties if these niche parties, such as the GPS, are perceived as an electoral threat. We can therefore expect the SP to counter this threat by addressing “green issues” with the aim of attracting GPS voters.


The SP emphasises “green issues” in an effort to win over GPS voters. The SP does this by proposing parliamentary bills that are similar in content to GPS bills.
