## Data and Methods

- in order to test the hypothesis, i will place parliamentary bills from the swiss national assemby into semantic space using document embeddings.
- specifically, i will examine parliamentary bills introduced either by the SP and GPS parties themselves or their members of parliament (MPs) that cover “green issues”
	- footnote: a range of different actors can put forward bills in parliament

- in order to capture the content similarity between bills introduced by the two parties, i group bills by party and by session. this means that a group contains parliamentary bills introduced by a party in a single session.
	- footnote: explain what a parliamentary session is
- i then calculate the average position of all bills in a group, i.e., the “middle point” or centroid of a group of bills in semantic space. this centroid represents the overall semantic content of all bills in a group, i.e., a summary that reflects the overall semantic content within a group. It effectively summarizes the collective characteristics or the "average" bill within that group, helping to identify the group’s central tendencies
- Analyzing centroids allows me to capture the general direction of the bills in a group.



- exploratory data analysis
	- current analysis (number of bills over time etc)
	- show number of bills by party strength; divide number of bills from a party by seats in parliament
- using embeddings, measure difference between texts
	- euclidean distance
	- cosine similarity
	- show difference between grouped by session and grouped by year, as there are outlier session where only few bills are introduced; maybe also filter out “Sondersessionen”, as these are very short and sometimes only cover a certain topic
- measuring distance between SP and greens over time 
	- on all topics: distance is constant
	- on environmental topics: distance decreases
	- differentiate between bills that only have the tag “environment” and bills with the most common co-tag, e.g. “environment” and “finance” 
- does one party move closer to the other party or do both parties move?

### Operationalisation
- Environmental Topic saliency
	- Google Trends?
	- Worry Barometer?
	- selects survey, as done by 2022 Lütch p. 171

### Model
y = distance between sp and greens
x = (lagged?) topic salience
