## Data & Methods

- back up statement that embeddings can be used to measure distance between texts and that using this method is legit in the context of comparing parliamentary bills

- exploratory data analysis
	- current analysis (number of bills over time etc)
	- show number of bills by party strength; divide number of bills from a party by seats in parliament
- using embeddings, measure difference between texts
	- euclidean distance
	- cosine similarity
	- show difference between grouped by session and grouped by year, as there are outlier session where only few bills are introduced; maybe also filter out “Sondersessionen”, as these are very short and sometimes only cover a certain topic
- measuring distance between SP and greens over time 
	- on all topics: distance is constant
	- on environmental topics: distance decreases
	- differentiate between bills that only have the tag “environment” and bills with the most common co-tag, e.g. “environment” and “finance” 
- does one party move closer to the other party or do both parties move?

### Operationalisation
- Environmental Topic saliency
	- Google Trends?
	- Worry Barometer?
	- selects survey, as done by 2022 Lütch p. 171

### Model
y = distance between sp and greens
x = (lagged?) topic salience
