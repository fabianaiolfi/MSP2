### Methods

```
In this section, you will describe the precise method that you use to test the relationship between your dependent variable and your independent variable.
```

- in a first step, i calculate the correlation between the dependent and independent variable using Pearson Correlation. 
- this is adequat because its a first, simple examination to see if there is a correlation between the two variables
	- assumptions: see https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter22.html
	- as both variables need to be normally distributed, i log-transform the distance variable

- in a second step, i model the relationship in a linear regression, to see if there is a linear relationship between the two variables. Given the data, this is the best-suited method because it allows me to test the relationship between two continuous variables.

i use this Model Specification:
Semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + google trends Topic Salience + error

- in a third step, i lag the dependent variable by 1 unit, in this case session. by doing so, i try to model the time-lag effect of google trends on parliamentary bills on sessions in the near future. this is a more realistic scenario, as i assume it takes a moment for parties to react to an increased public salience

i use this Model Specification:
lagged Semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + google trends Topic Salience + error

- to test the relationship between the dependent and independent variable, i specify the following models

Model Specification 1
Semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + selects Topic Salience + error
