### Methods

```
In this section, you will describe the precise method that you use to test the relationship between your dependent variable and your independent variable.
```

- to test the relationship between the dependent and independent variable, i specify the following models
- i model selects and google trends separately, as i assume them to be highly correlated

Model Specification 1
Semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + selects Topic Salience + error

Model Specification 2
Semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + google trends Topic Salience + error

Tentative Model Specification 3: lagged?

- I test the relationship between semantic distance between bills and topic salience using linear regression. Given the data, this is the best-suited method because it allows me to test the relationship between two continuous variables.
