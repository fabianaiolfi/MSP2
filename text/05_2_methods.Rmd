### Methods

```
In this section, you will describe the precise method that you use to test the relationship between your dependent variable and your independent variable.
```

Differencing: using the difference between values
- due to the limited scope of this seminar paper, i keep the analysis simple and will examine the change between variables between observations instead of creating a time series model
- i thus calculate the change in both the independent and dependent variable from one session to the next and use these as my independent and dependent variables instead

Adding Time Lag
- i lag the dependent variable by 1 unit, ie by one session. by doing so, i try to model the time-lag effect of environmental topics amongst the public on parliamentary bills on sessions. this is a more realistic scenario, as i assume it takes a moment for parties to react to an increased public salience

### Correlation
- in a first step, i calculate the correlation between the dependent and independent variable using Pearson Correlation. 
- this is adequat because its a first, simple examination to see if there is a correlation between the two variables
	- assumptions: see https://ademos.people.uic.edu/Chapter22.html
	- as both variables need to be normally distributed, i log-transform the distance variable
- i examine the unlagged and lagged variable

### Linear Regression
- in a second step, i model the relationship in a linear regression, to see if there is a linear relationship between the two variables, specifically the difference. Given the data, this is the best-suited method because it allows me to test the relationship between two continuous variables.

i use this Model Specification:
Change in semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + change in google trends Topic Salience + error

i use this Model Specification:
lagged Change in semantic distance between sp and greens = beta + change in google trends Topic Salience + error
