## Results

<!--
This section describes the results of your analysis. It includes any relevant tables and figures. Wherever possible present figures rather than tables. Describe all figures and tables in words. They do not speak for themselves. But, at the same time, they should also be described well enough in the title, axis labels, and caption that readers can understand the necessary information by looking at the tables/figures alone.

You must discuss both statistical and substantive significance!

As predicted by our theory, we see that [X] has a statistically significant effect on [Y] at the p<0.05 level across all the models that we run.
