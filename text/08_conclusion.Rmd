## Conclusion

- this paper sets out to examine why parliamentary bills on environemntal topics introduced by mainstream left parties and green parties have become more similar in content over the past twenty years

theory
- to answer this question, i turn to literature on political agendas, specifically “party system agendas”. 
- in this context, parties place issues on their agendas that are salient to the public. also, parties respond to each other’s agendas.
- research shows that parties that are ideologically close to each other tend to be more responsive to each other’s agendas.
- one way of placing issues on the agenda is by introducing parliamentary bills that touch upon such issues

<!--
- Future research:
	- Use fine tuned embeddings
	- look at topic saliency more specifically amongst left-wing and green voters, i.e. their own voters, as described by (2013 Lazarus, p. 226, 227)
	- further similarity measures
		- 2016 Heidarian
		- a more tried and tested / systematic approach: Word Mover’s Distance (2015 Kusner)
		- delve into more time series specific analysis
	- find more refined ways of measuring public salience of environmental topics, e.g. using news sources
	- look at other countries
	- what constitutes an “environmental” issue?
