## Conclusion

- this paper sets out to examine why parliamentary bills on environemntal topics introduced by mainstream left parties and green parties have become more similar in content over the past twenty years

lit & theory
- to answer this question, i turn to literature on political agendas, specifically “party system agendas”. 
- in this context, parties place issues on their agendas that are salient to the public. also, parties respond to each other’s agendas.
- one way of placing issues on the agenda is by introducing parliamentary bills that touch upon such issues
- research shows that parties that are ideologically close to each other tend to be more responsive to each other’s agendas.
- specifically in the context of mainstream left-wing parties and green parties, left-wing parties focus on environmental issues in order to win over green voters. for this to happen, three conditions have to me met, namely high environmental topic salience amongst the public, an electoral system beneficial for smaller parties and the green party is perceived as a significant electoral threat by left-wing parites
- following the literature, we can assume that when environmental issues become more salient amongst the public, we can expect mainstream left-wing parties to place environmental issues on the “party system agenda” through the introduction of parliamentary bills.

swiss case
- in order to test this assumption, i turn to switzerland
- switzerland is suited to examine this because environmental issues have become mroe salient amongst the public in the past twenty years, it has an electoral system that is beneficial for small parties and the Social Democrats (SP), the mainstream left-wing party, perceive the Green Party (GPS) as an electoral threat due to their ideological proximity.

results
- i apply a text as data approach and measure the content similarity of parliamentary bills by using word embeddings.
- environmental bills are placed in semantic space, grouped by party and parliamentary session. i then calculate the middle point of each group and measure the euclidean distance between SP and GPS middle points over time
- i use the popularity of the search term “climate change”, provided by google trends, to explain the change in distance between groups of parliamentary bills.
- results show that an increase in the search term popularity is associated with a lagged increase in content similarity between parliamentary bills introduced by the SP and the GPS
- this suggests that the SP is reacting to the GPS’s agenda, sees it as an electoral threat and wishes to win over green voters

future research
- future research should apply more time series specific analysis, as this present research does not take this into account
- in addition to the Euclidean distance used to measure the semantic similarity between parliamentary bills, other similarity measures should be taken into account, such as the Word Mover’s Distance [@kusnerWordEmbeddingsDocument2015] or more advanced geometric approaches such as a method proposed by @heidarianHybridGeometricApproach2016.
- when looking into pre-trained word embedding alternatives, future research could apply an approach where the embeddings are fine tuned for political texts, specifically parliamentary bills. this would represent the content meaning of the bills more precisely, allowing for a more precise measurement of content similarity.
- this paper takes a very simple approach when categorising environmental bills. this can be fleshed out in further studies, e.g., by using more advanced natural language processing techniques that can detect environmental topics in the content of bills.
- future research could also look beyond parliamentary bills, e.g., taking party manifestos or parliamentary speeches into account when examining how agendas are set.
- future research should find more refined ways of measuring public salience of environmental topics. one such source could be news and media sources. taking this approach would also lead to differentiating between groups in society, as public opinion may differ between different groups of people
- finally, it makes sense to look at countries beyond switzerland, as the growing salience of environmental topics is a global phenomenon that will influence public opinion and politics long into the future.
