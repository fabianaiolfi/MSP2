- Future research:
	- Use fine tuned embeddings
	- look at topic saliency more specifically amongst left-wing and green voters, i.e. their own voters, as described by (2013 Lazarus, p. 226, 227)
	- further similarity measures
		- 2016 Heidarian
		- a more tried and tested / systematic approach: Word Mover’s Distance (2015 Kusner)
		- delve into more time series specific analysis
	- find more refined ways of measuring public salience of environmental topics, e.g. using news sources
