## Abstract

## Introduction

## Literature Review
- issue competition: which topics are placed on the agenda and how do parties react to this?
- embeddings: how they show the similarity between texts; how they can encompass/convey the meaning of a text as a numerical value

## Theory
- parties react to issues put forward by other parites

## Data & Methods
- using embeddings, measure difference between texts
	- euclidean distance
	- cosine similarity

## Conclusion
- Future research:
	- Use fine tuned embeddings
