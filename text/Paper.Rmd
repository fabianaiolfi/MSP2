## Abstract

## Introduction

## Literature Review
- issue competition: which topics are placed on the agenda and how do parties react to this?
- embeddings: how they show the similarity between texts; how they can encompass/convey the meaning of a text as a numerical value
- most papers use party manifesto data (manually tagged?) (e.g. 2014 Green (see p. 752 for description of manual approach))

## Theory
- schattschneider (1960): choice of conflicts allocates power
- parties react to issues put forward by other parites: what makes parties put forward certain topics?
- introducing parliamentary bills as a form of political communication: when a party introduces a bill in parliament, it communicates to other parties and also to its voter base
- Set up hypotheses

## Data & Methods
- exploratory data analysis
	- current analysis (number of bills over time etc)
	- show number of bills by party strength; divide number of bills from a party by seats in parliament
- using embeddings, measure difference between texts
	- euclidean distance
	- cosine similarity
	- show difference between grouped by session and grouped by year, as there are outlier session where only few bills are introduced; maybe also filter out “Sondersessionen”, as these are very short and sometimes only cover a certain topic
- measuring distance between SP and greens over time 
	- on all topics: distance is constant
	- on environmental topics: distance decreases
- does one party move closer to the other party or do both parties move?

### Operationalisation
- Environmental Topic saliency
	- Google Trends?
	- Worry Barometer?

## Conclusion
- Future research:
	- Use fine tuned embeddings
